## Advent of Code 2022 - Day 11

Written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) `4.14.0` and built with Dune `3.6.1`.

Requires the [Lens](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/lens/) module. Install it with `opam install lens` before building.

To build: run `dune build`.

Both source files are largely identical. Forgive me for not having time for the polishing up.

### Problem 1

`_build/default/prob1.exe`

Note it's named `exe` also on a mac.

### Problem 2

`_build/default/prob2.exe`
